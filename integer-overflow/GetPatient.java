/**
 * An example of Integer Overflow.
 * 
 * The system is supposed to pull the health records of the patient named 
 * "Chuck Norris". But, in obtaining  * the patientID, it casts a "long" to 
 * an "int", which silently wraps around to a different patient ID (18 
 * instead). The wrong records are returned, and a HIPAA violation ensues.
 * 
 * Mitigations for this example: 
 * 		* Don't cast to int if you don't have to.
 * 		* Check for overflow yourself when it's important.
