		The behavior of the example is dependent on the implementation
		of the stack. On most hardware, the stack grows down from the highest 
		memory address to the lowest. This is why overflowing the end of 'str' 
		overwrites the array that was declared before it.

		The small size of the buffer 'str' means it will
		likely be padded for memory alignment purposes, so you may need
		to type several characters past the end of the buffer before a change
		to 'secret' is apparent.
